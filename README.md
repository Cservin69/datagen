This is a Rust program that generates transaction data for clients. It uses the following libraries:

    rand for generating random data
    chrono for working with dates and times
    rayon for parallel processing
    serde_json for parsing JSON data

The program reads client ids from a JSON file and writes them to a CSV file. It then generates transaction data for the clients using random values for each column.
Modules

The program is split into two modules:
data

This module contains the data used by the program. It has the following sub-modules:

    clients: Contains a list of client ids
    countries: Contains a list of countries
    ccy: Contains a list of currencies
    products: Contains a list of products and services

myerror

This module defines a custom error type called MyError. The program returns this error type if an error occurs.
Main Function

The main function is the entry point of the program. It has the following steps:

    Define the paths to the input JSON file and output CSV files.
    Parse client ids from the input JSON file and write them to the output CSV file.
    Read the client ids from the output CSV file into a vector.
    Generate transaction data for each client id using random values for each column.
    Write the transaction data to a CSV file.

Helper Functions
parse_client_ids_from_json

This function reads client ids from a JSON file and writes them to a CSV file. It has the following parameters:

    json_file_path: The path to the input JSON file.
    output_file_path: The path to the output CSV file.

parse_client_ids_and_insert_into_vec

This function reads client ids from a JSON file and writes them to a CSV file, and also stores them in a vector. It has the following parameters:

    json_file_path: The path to the input JSON file.
    output_file_path: The path to the output CSV file.
    clients: An Arc wrapped Mutexed vector that will hold the client ids.

random_element

This function returns a random element from a vector. It has the following parameter:

    vec: The vector to select a random element from.

If the vector is empty, the function will return a custom error MyError::IoError(io::Error::new(io::ErrorKind::Other, "vector is empty")).
